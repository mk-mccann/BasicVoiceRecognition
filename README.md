BasicVoiceRecognition
=====================
The beginings of a final project for a Signals and Systems class (BME271) at Duke University. 
Current goal is to first use Foruier Analysis to identify the different types of vowels in words, and to then potentially use frequency data to train a machine learning model to do basic voice recognition.
